        <p>
            Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო, romanized: sakartvelo, IPA:) is a country located in Eastern Europe<br>
            and West Asia. It is part of the Caucasus region, bounded by the Black Sea to the west, Russia to the<br> north and northeast, Turkey to the southwest, Armenia to the south, and by Azerbaijan to the southeast.<br> The country covers an area of 69,700 square kilometres (26,900 sq mi), and has a population of 3.7<br> million people. Tbilisi is its capital and largest city, home to roughly a third of the Georgian population.<br>
            <br>
            Georgia has been a wine production site since 6,000 BC, being the earliest known location of<br> winemaking in the world. During the classical era, several kingdoms emerged in what is now<br> Georgia, such as Colchis and Iberia. In the early 4th century, Georgians officially adopted Christianity,<br> which contributed to the unification of early Georgian states. In the Middle Ages, the unified Kingdom<br> of Georgia reached its Golden Age during the reign of King David IV and Queen Tamar. Thereafter, the<br> kingdom declined and eventually disintegrated under the hegemony of various regional powers,<br> including the Mongols, the Ottoman Empire, and various dynasties of Persia. In 1783, one of the<br> Georgian kingdoms entered into an alliance with the Russian Empire but Russia reneged on its promises<br> and instead proceeded to annex the territory of modern Georgia piece-by-piece against the wish of the<br> local rulers.<br>
            <br>
            After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Georgia emerged as an independent republic under German<br> protection.Following World War I, Georgia was invaded and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1922,<br> becoming one of its constituent republics. In the 1980s, an independence movement grew quickly,<br> leading to Georgia's secession from the Soviet Union in April 1991. For most of the subsequent decade,<br> post-Soviet Georgia suffered from economic crisis, political instability and secessionist wars in Abkhazia<br> and South Ossetia. Following the peaceful Rose Revolution in 2003, Georgia strongly pursued a <br>pro-Western foreign policy; it introduced a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at integration<br> into the European Union and NATO. The country's Western orientation soon led to worsening relations<br> with Russia, which culminated in the Russo-Georgian War of 2008, and entrenched Russian occupation of<br> a portion of Georgia.<br>
            <br>
            Georgia is a representative democracy governed as a unitary parliamentary republic. It is a developing<br> country with a very high Human Development Index. Economic reforms since independence have led<br> to higher levels of economic freedom, as well as reductions in corruption indicators, poverty, and<br> unemployment. It was one of the first countries in the world to legalize cannabis, becoming the only<br> former-socialist state to do so. The country is a member of international organizations, such as the Council<br> of Europe, the OSCE, Eurocontrol, the EBRD, the BSEC, the GUAM, the ADB, the WTO, and the Energy<br> Community.
