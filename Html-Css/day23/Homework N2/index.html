        <p id="p-1" class="color">Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. As<br>of March 2023, Apple is the world's largest company by market capitalization, and with<br>US$394.3 billion the largest technology company by 2022 revenue. As of June 2022, Apple is the<br>fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales; the largest manufacturing company by revenue;<br>and the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It is considered one of the Big Five<br>American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon,<br>Meta, and Microsoft.<br><br>Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and<br>Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and<br>Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a<br>best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant<br>financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces,<br>including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called<br>"1984". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused<br>problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and<br>founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.<br><br>As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost<br>considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on<br>Intel-powered PC clones (also known as "Wintel"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company<br>bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the<br>company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics<br>including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the "Think different"<br>campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and<br>acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011<br>for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.<br><br>Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then<br>at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over<br>$3 trillion. The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its<br>environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials<br>sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It has<br>also been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.<br>
