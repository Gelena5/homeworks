        <p id="p-1" class="color">Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (/ˈhwɑːweɪ/ HWAH-way; Chinese: 华为; pinyin: Huáwéi) is a<br>Chinese multinational technology corporation headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong. It designs,<br>develops, manufactures and sells telecommunications equipment, consumer electronics, smart<br>devices and various rooftop solar products. The corporation was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a<br>former officer in the People's Liberation Army (PLA).<br><br>Initially focused on manufacturing phone switches, Huawei has expanded to more than 170 countries<br>to include building telecommunications networks, providing operational and consulting services and<br>equipment, and manufacturing communications devices for the consumer market. It overtook<br>Ericsson in 2012 as the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world.Huawei<br>surpassed Apple and Samsung, in 2018 and 2020, respectively, to become the largest smartphone<br>manufacturer worldwide. Amidst its rise, Huawei has been accused of intellectual property<br>infringement, for which it has settled with companies like Cisco.<br><br>Questions regarding the extent of state influence on Huawei have revolved around its national<br>champions role in China, subsidies and financing support from state entities, and reactions of the<br>Chinese government in light of oppositions in certain countries to Huawei's participation in 5G.  Its<br>software and equipment have been linked to the mass surveillance of Uyghurs and Xinjiang internment<br>camps, drawing sanctions from the US.<br><br>The company has faced difficulties in some countries arising from concerns that its equipment may<br>enable surveillance by the Chinese government due to perceived connections with the country's<br>military and intelligence agencies. Huawei has argued that critics such as the US government<br>have not shown evidence of espionage. Experts say that China's 2014 Counter-Espionage Law and<br>2017 National Intelligence Law can compel Huawei and other companies to cooperate with state<br>intelligence. In 2012, Australian and US intelligence agencies concluded that a hack on Australia's<br>telecom networks was conducted by or through Huawei, although the two network operators have<br>disputed that information.<br><br>In the midst of a trade war between China and the United States, the US government alleged that<br>Huawei had violated sanctions against Iran and restricted it from doing business with American<br>companies. In June 2019, Huawei cut jobs at its Santa Clara research center, and in December Ren<br>Zhengfei said it was moving to Canada. In 2020, Huawei agreed to sell the Honor brand to a<br>state-owned enterprise of the Shenzhen government to "ensure its survival" under US sanctions. In<br>November 2022, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) banned sales or import of<br>equipment made by Huawei out of national security concerns. Other countries such as India, Japan,<br>members of the Five Eyes, and ten European Union states have also banned or restricted Huawei<br>members of the Five Eyes, and ten European Union states have also banned or restricted Huawei<br></p>
