        <p id="p1">History of Tbilisi covers 1500 years from the date of<br> formation to the present time. Story of the capital of Georgia is a blend of myths and facts.<br> According to a famous legend, back in year 458 A.D. King Vakhtang I<br> Gorgasal was hunting in the woods on the banks of the Kura River and wounded a pheasant (some sources<br> say it was a deer). The animal ran to the sulphur spring and immediately healed with hot waters. The King<br> was amazed with healing features of the spring and decided to build a city around it. This is how Tbilisi<br> (which means “warm”) appeared. In present there are famous baths in the place of the Sulphur springs that<br> can be found around the city.<br>
        <br>
        However, this is just a beautiful legend, and the real story is more prosaic. The first chronicle of Tbilisi as a<br> fortress over the river dates back to the 4th century A.D. At that times, there already was a Persian citadel<br> that later was named Narikala, and the capital of Georgian kings was in Mtskheta, 20 km away from Tbilisi.<br> In the 5th century the King Vakhtang conquered and restored the Persian fortress. After the construction<br> the capital was moved there. By the way, archeological findings state that this territory was already<br> populated in the 4th millennium B.C.</p>

        <p id="p2">At the same time Metekhi fortress was erected on the other bank of the Kura, where today there is a<br>church with the same name and a monument to Vakhtang, founder of Tbilisi. This citadel became the<br>residence of all following rulers of Georgia. The city was also surrounded by fortress walls, and the church<br>Anchiskhati was built at that time. It is one of the rare constructions that has been preserved up to our<br>days. The city however did not remain long in the hands of the Georgian kings and in year 626 it was seized<br>by Persians who considered the place as their northern outpost. Thus, it was the beginning of blending of<br>Christian and Zoroastrian cultures in the city. Since then, there has only been one temple of fire<br>worshippers Ateshgah preserved; it is hidden from ordinary people and located inside a private residence.<br><br>Persian rule did not last long, in 653 the Arab troops of Khabib ibn Maslama came to the Caucasus. There<br>was no bloodshed but Tbilisi and the entire Georgia was under the vassal status and was bound to pay<br>tribute, and the Arabs guaranteed security of the residents and preservation of churches and religions. In<br>736, the city was seized by a more aggressive Arab commander Mervan II ibn Mukhammad, who founded<br>the Tbilisi caliphate. However, he did not manage to conquer other cities and Tbilisi was the only Muslim<br>city in the Caucasus. Emir of Tbilisi could not hold his power and even tried to separate it from the Arab<br>Caliphate but his attempt failed; it was followed by a punitive army that came to the city and the Christian<br>population had to migrate to Abkhazia.<br><br>After centuries of the Arab domination, the new turn in the history of Tbilisi was the triumphal appearance<br>of the Georgian King David the Builder. In 1122, he won the city back, made it the capital of the united<br>Georgia and began constructions, for what he had been named “The Builder”. Along with this, David was a<br>loyal and tolerant ruler; Muslim population of Tbilisi was not prosecuted and representatives of different<br>religions lived side by side. During his reign, the capital turned into one of the largest trade and crafts<br>centers of the Caucasus.<br><br>This period in the history of Tbilisi is called the Golden Age. As a rich city, it attracted the attention of the<br>conquerors: first, in 1226, the city was ruined by the troops of the Khorezm Sultan Jalaliddin Manguberdi,<br>and later in 1238, the city was invaded by the Mongol armies of Genghis Khan.<br><br>Conquests and battles devastated Tbilisi. Later in 1366, an outbreak of the Great Plague struck the city and<br>in 1386 it was invaded by the armies of Tamerlane. During the 16-17thcenturies it was occupied by Persians<br>and Turks. These centuries were the hardship times for Tbilisi, but it stood against it all.<br><br>In the 18th century, Tbilisi became a small change in the big political game of the Russian and Ottoman<br>Empires and Persia. Georgian rulers were in a difficult state without knowing which side to take. In the end,<br>they turned to Russia and there was signed Treaty of Georgievsk between rulers of these two states.<br>However, Russia did not always consider interests of Georgia and it turned out that in 1795 Tbilisi was<br>besieged by the Persian army, seized and completely destroyed. Later, Russia has reassessed the strategic<br>importance of Georgia and in 1800 there was signed a manifest of joining the country to the Russian<br>Empire, and sometime later new turn of development began in Tbilisi.<br><br>In the 19th century, Tbilisi steadily and continuously developed: new enterprises were set up, trading net<br>and the population increased. The city became the center of the entire Caucasus; famous writers, poets<br>and artists from Russia and Europe visited the city. Moreover, novelties such as telegraph, an opera theatre<br>and the Caucasian Railroad appeared. The only tragic event was the earthquake of 1827 that had destroyed<br>many houses. That is why the biggest part of the Old Tbilisi today is presented with houses of the 19th<br>century.<br></p>

        <p id="p3">In the beginning of the 20th century, Tbilisi was one of the revolutionary centers of the social-democrats<br>who were against the Tsarist rule. Here the future leader of the USSR Josef Stalin began his work. He was<br>the Georgian from the town of Gori, where today there is a museum dedicated to him. In 1918, after the<br>overthrow of the Tsarist power and the beginning of the struggles of political parties, Georgia announced<br>its independence. However, later the country was included into the structure of the Soviet Union (USSR). It<br>was the time when the monumental construction and destruction of religion monuments had started.<br>During the WWII there were few factories evacuated to Tbilisi from the west of Russia that positively<br>influenced the industry of the city in the post-war years.<br><br>In the end of the 20th century, along with gaining independence of Georgia, Tbilisi kept the status of the<br>capital, but the country was in the agony. Different regions did not accept the central power, there were<br>uprisings and Tbilisi was the arena of some tragic events. In the beginning of the 21st century, the Rose<br>revolution took place in Tbilisi. Only in the recent years of the newest history of Tbilisi, peaceful and quiet<br>life can be observed.<br></p>
