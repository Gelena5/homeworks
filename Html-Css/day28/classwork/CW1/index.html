            Santa Claus, legendary figure who is the traditional patron of Christmas in the<br> United States and other countries, bringing gifts to children. His popular image<br> is based on traditions associated with Saint Nicholas, a 4th-century Christian saint.<br> Father Christmas fills the role in many European countries.<br><br>

            The Dutch are credited with transporting the legend of Saint Nicholas (Sinterklaas)<br> to New Amsterdam (now New York City), along with the custom of giving gifts<br> and sweets to children on his feast day, December 6. The current depiction of Santa<br> Claus is based on images drawn by cartoonist Thomas Nast for Harper’s Weekly<br> beginning in 1863. Nast’s Santa owed much to the description given in the poem <br>“A Visit from St. Nicholas” (also known as “’Twas the Night Before Christmas”),<br> first published in 1823. The image was further defined by the popular Santa Claus<br> advertisements created for the Coca-Cola Company from 1931 by illustrator<br> Haddon Sundblum. Sundblum’s Santa was a portly white-bearded gentleman dressed<br> in a red suit with a black belt and white fur trim, black boots, and a soft red cap.
